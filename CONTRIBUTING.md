We are recommending that commit messages should be done in the following manner. If not using Gitmoji please leave the emojis off. They are there merely for visual purposes.

```ts
‚ú® feat: short_description /** if a new feature is added */
üêõ bugfix: short_description /** if a bug is fixed */
‚ö†Ô∏è hotfix: short_description /** if a hotfix is committed */
üö© release: short_description /** if a release is committed */

```

#### Issues

#### Code Style Guide

Code should satisfy the following:

- Variable names in `snake_case`.
- Function names in `camelCase`.
- Have no `lint` issues.
  - There is a recommended VSCode Extension in the repository.
- Have meaningful file names, directory names, and directory structure. We have provided a baseline.
- Have a scope for any refactoring, scaling, or general fixes.

## Semver spec

Utilization of the below schema for semantic versioning should be followed:

- `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
- If needing to use an `alpha`, `beta`, or `rc` build, please add the following after `<patch>`
  - *Alpha:* `-alpha+<YYYYMMDD>.<HHMM>`
  - *Beta:* `-beta+<YYYYMMDD>.<HHMM>`
  - *RC (Release Candidate):* -`rc.<number>`

## Git Flow and Ozmosis Widgeting

We will be utilizing `Git Flow` in order to work as efficiently as possible. Here is a helpful guide in expectations:

- `git flow feature start <feature_name>`
  - Starts a branch named: `feat/<feature_name>`
  - This branch is based on the `/dev` branch.
- `git flow bugfix start <bug_name>`
  - Starts a branch named: `bugfix/<bug_name>`
  - Based on the `/dev` branch.
- `git flow hotfix start <hotfix_name>`
  - Starts a branch named: `hotfix/<hotfix_name>`
  - Based on `/main` branch.
  - **Note: Generally used after a release for quick fixes.**
- `git flow release start <version>`
  - Starts a new release branch under `release/<version>`
  - Based on `/dev` branch by default but can be based on a different base.
- `git flow support start <version> <base>`
  - Starts a support branch for a particular version of the `/main` branch.
  - Should only be used when needing to affect the `/main` branch. Ideal example flow would be:

```sh
git flow support start 0.1.0 main
git flow hotfix start fix_denoms support/0.1.0
git flow hotfix finish fix_denoms

# If adding features
  git flow feature start create_nirvana support/0.1.0
  git flow feature finish create_nirvana

git flow release start 0.1.1 support/0.1.0
git flow release finish 0.1.1
```
