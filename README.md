# Ozmosis Widget

A swap widget created by OzMage Validation. Bootstrapped with [`create-cosmos-app`](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/create-cosmos-app). This widget should be self contained and able to be ported onto any `React-Based` site.

## Getting Started

### Local/Dev Environment

You'll need to install the packages and run a development server. This assumes you already have Node.js/Git installed on your computer. If you do not, please visit: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version.

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

The repositories will install. Most errors should be ignorable. Then, Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

We have attempted to keep everything organized and documented as well as possible, but if you see places for improvement, please don't hesitate to [contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## Learn More

OzMage has stripped some items out of the original `create-cosmos-app` and tooled it for greater decentralization, we've done our best to document as much as we can to ensure you aren't lost.
